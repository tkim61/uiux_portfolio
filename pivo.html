      <h1>Iterative Design</h1>
      <p>
        For this project, we worked in groups of four to design a website for a startup.
        <br>
        We were explicitly told not to look at any UI/UX material the company had already made.
        <br>
        We based our design only on their <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/pivo-technology-inc">ycombinator demo day</a> page.

      <h1>Design and Initial Prototyping</h1>
      <p>
        <br>
        We chose the company <a href="https://pivo.africa/#/">Pivo</a>, a mobile banking app for African supply chain
        workers, like truckers.
        <br>
        Like in previous projects, we started with prototypes.
        <br>
        The lowfi prototypes and the initial design focused on three essential screens for any banking app.
        <br>
        We based our designs off of existing apps, like Zelle and Venmo.
        <br>
        We didn't go all the way to building a full site this time though, and instead the final submission was a
        works-like hifi prototype in figma.
        <br>

      <h1>HiFi Prototype</h1>
      <p>
        <br>
        The hifi prototype was implemented in <a
          href="https://www.figma.com/proto/RyLm0d33U3S0sbBPwj6IqA/Pivo-Design?node-id=9%3A272&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=9%3A272">Figma</a>.
        <br>
        Like with previous website the "card" system works well here!
        <br>
        We chose shapes with round edges, and soft colors for a relaxed aesthetic to balance out the
        oft-stressful nature of banking.

          <h3>Industry Feedback</h3>
          Once we had a works-like prototype, we showed it to a group of our peers and an industry professional.
          <br>
          We were excited to get overwhelmingly posiitve comments!
          <br>
          The only adjustments we made were turning the settings page into a drop-down menu, and a
          few typos on the first draft.
          <br>
          Unfortunately, we only saved the final version of the protoype, so the pictures above are of the final
          version, after we incorporated feedback.
          <br>
          It was great to hear from an industry professional, and get a sense of how industry-level UX work is done.

          <h3>User Testing</h3>
          Once we had our final design, we used UserTesting to run 3 tests on our website with random users.
          <br>
          Each user was given a task to complete, like sending money.
          <br>
          We asked each user to talk through their use process as they tried to complete each task.
          <br>
          We found that users had an easy time using our app, but also that unclear task directions can be just as confusing to a user as a bad interface.
          <br>
          We asked users to look at their "user info" which in our minds was the same as "Account Details" but to our users it was a unclear.

      <h1>Reflections</h1>

        <div class="item4-col-12">
          In this project we learned about the process of designing a new interface completely from scratch.  
          Working as a team offered a more realistic working experience than solo. 
          Comparing and combining many different designs was a good experince, our final design was definitley better than what any of us would have done individually.
          We learned that even when designing for a completley new startup, 
          by building off of and combining existing apps, we could get ourselves close to a final design rather quickly.
          In user testing we learned about how to instructions that are specific enough to be followed relativley easily, but not so specific they fail to test the site's usability.
