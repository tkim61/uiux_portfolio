            <h1>Submission Template</h1>
            <p>
                After completing our first assignment in a wild rush, I wanted to have a template website to be the basis for future submissions.
                <br>
                This website is based off of that template, and shows off some of the basic HTML elements I worked on implementing.
                <br>
                Inspiration for this website comes from live coding in lecture, and <a href=https://youtu.be/oYRda7UtuhA> Easy Tutorials on YouTube</a>.
                <br>
                Many of the design elements of this portfolio, including all the fonts, come from this template.
                <br>
                This is all in flexbox and pretty close to vanilla html and css.  Even with bootstrap it helps a lot to be able to understand basic html at this level.
                <br>
                Since I'm just showcasing my work, I didn't think I'd need any fancy javascript.

            <h1>Info Cards</h1>
            <p>I knew there would be quite a bit of prototyping ahead, so I designed the site to feature easy to view comparisons between several things.
                <br>
                The "just text" would be good for presenting ideation, user profiling, or anything that can be represented as just text.
                <br>
                Images, looks-like prototypes, empathy maps, and state diagrams are all usually rendered as images, so I made sure to have an easy way of dealing with images.
                <br> 
                I found the "card" or "row-col" system works really well for this type of website.  Each individual piece is nicely packaged in an easily-accessible block.
                <br>  
                Most websites can be distilled into some sort of card-based thing, at least from a layout perspective.
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="item-col">
                    <h3>Just Text</h3>
                    <img src="images/template_text_boxes.png">
                </div>
                <div class="item-col">
                    <h3>Text with Pictures</h3>
                    <img src="images/template_images1.png">

                <div class="item-col">

            <h1>User Profiles</h1>
            <p>
                This is basically just two cards under a header.  I am quite proud of the profile icons though!
                <br>
                Plus, arranging the text and images within the reviews gave me a much better understanding of managing items in grid format.
                <br>
                For the remaining user-facing projects, we didn't make submissions the same way we did for personas, so this format didn't actually end up being used that much.
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="item2-col">

            <h1>Commentary</h1>
            <p>
                Most assignments have at least a section or two that is essentially just putting words on a page.
                <br>
                I could just have regular paragraph text floating in space, but I think a card makes it look just a little cleaner.
                <br>
                I think I learned more about HTML and CSS from building this website than on any of the assignments we were actually assigned.

                        Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. 
                    It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… 
                    He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. 
                    The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. 
                    He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, 
                    which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, 
                    then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
