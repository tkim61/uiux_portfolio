            <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
            <p>
                This assignment was an exercise in taking an online interface in which we saw room for improvement, and then designing a new website in reponse.
                <br>
                We had to identify problems or improvement points, especially with respect to accessibility.
                <br>
                Before creating the new website, we first went through several round of prototyping - first as sketches/wireframes, then as high-fi, looks-like prototypes, complete with a style guide.

                <p>
                    <br>
                    I chose the local liquor store <a href="http://highspiritsliquors.com/">High Spirits</a>.  
                    <br>
                    I believed that most people visiting the site would be wanting to visit the store, not learn about sales or the store's story.
                    <br>
                    I wanted to make sure that all the most important information for a potential visitor was visible right from the start.
                    <br>
                    A picture of the store, hours, and location are the most important pieces of information to have if you are looking for the physical store.
                    <br>
                    I made lowfi prototypes in pencil and hifi prototypes in figma.  
                    <br>
                    The additional links at the stop stayed, although I put them in a hamburger menu in the mobile version.

                <h1>Implementation</h1>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    I then made a visual design style guide and implemented a <a href="/Users/thomaskim/brown/cs1300/responsive_redesign/highspiritsnew.html">real website</a>.  
                    My HTML skills still needed some work.  I couldn't figure out how to get everything centered exactly how I wanted, that's why the area at the top is off-center with 
                    the address and other information.  I also couldn't get the picture to be size I wanted so I could put the contact info right below it like in the prototypes. 
                    I did this assignment at the same time as my template site, so I was pretty rushed when putting together the final site.  It's not perfect but I think I 
                    accomplished the main goal of making the site more accessible.  I also wish I could have gone their and got a picture myself, this picture is from google images, and was not taken in the best lighting.

                        This project was a valuable learning experience in how much time it takes to build even a relativley simple website.
                        I thought after building the template site, that building the final site would be easy, but it turns out getting everything
                        to work out exactly how you want it more complicated than the simple nature of what you're trying to do might suggest.  
                        If I were to do this again, I would definitley do higher-quality wireframes in a real wireframing app, where annotating is easier too.
                        Since I was the one who would be implementing at the end of the day, I changed many things between versions without really documenting anything.
                        In a real assignment I would want to make a better record of my choices, which also means reflecting more and making each design choice with more intention, 
                        even small ones.
