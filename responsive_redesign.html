            <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
            <p>
                This assignment was an exercise in taking an online interface in which we saw room for improvement, and
                then designing a new website in reponse.
                <br>
                We had to identify problems or improvement points, especially with respect to accessibility, and fix them.
                <br>
                Before creating the new website, we went through several round of prototyping - first as
                sketches/wireframes, then as high-fi, looks-like prototypes, complete with a style guide.

            <h1>Prototypes</h1>
            <p>
                <br>
                I chose the local liquor store <a href="http://highspiritsliquors.com/">High Spirits</a>.
                <br>
                I believed that most people visiting the site would be wanting to visit the store, not learn about sales
                or the store's story.
                <br>
                I wanted to make sure that all the most important information for a potential visitor was visible right
                from the start.
                <br>
                A picture of the store, hours, and location are the most important pieces of information to have if you
                are looking for the physical store.
                <br>
                I made lowfi prototypes in pencil and hifi prototypes in figma.
                <br>
                The additional links at the top of the original website stayed, although I put them in a hamburger menu in the mobile version.
                <br>
                <br>

            <h1>Implementation</h1>
            <p>
                <br>
                I made a visual design style guide and implemented a <a
                    href="/Users/thomaskim/brown/cs1300/responsive_redesign/highspiritsnew.html">real website</a>.
                <br>
                At the time, my HTML skills were still at a beginner level. 
                <br>
                They still are, but I think they're significantly better than they were when I did this project. 
                <br>
                I had trouble laying out all the pieces the way I wanted. 
                <br>
                The area at the top is off-center with the address and other information. 
                <br>
                I also couldn't get the picture to be size I wanted so I could put the contact info right below it while still being a normal size like in the prototypes.

                        This project was a valuable learning experience in how much time it takes to build even a
                        relativley simple website.
                        I thought after building the template site, that building the final site would be easy, but it
                        turns out getting everything
                        to work out exactly how you want it more complicated than the simple nature of what you're
                        trying to do might suggest.
                        If I were to do this again, I would definitley do higher-quality wireframes in a real
                        wireframing app, where annotating is easier too.
                        Since I was the one who would be implementing at the end of the day, I changed many things
                        between versions without really documenting anything.
                        If I was working for a real customer, I would want to make a better record of my choices, which also means
                        reflecting more and making each design choice with more intention,
                        even small ones.
                        I did this assignment at the same time as my template site, and I was more rushed than I expected to be when putting together
                        the final site. 
                        It's not perfect but I think I accomplished the main goal of giving users the most relevant information as efficiently as possible. 
                        I also wish I took a picture of the store myself, because this picture is from google images, and was not taken in the best lighting.
